1. The bloom filter mutex will not go along with spinlock of the lists.
Most probably will have to change them to spinlocks. This is applicable only for
tmem_backend.
EDIT: It seems this won't be required as before accessing the bloom filters all
the spinlocks are unlocked.

2. Test the leader_server_client and local_server_client separately, as the
protocol was changed to send the size of bloom filter in bits to other RS from
the leader_server.

3. Should I use bloom_filter_unref before freeing up my bloom filter and others?
